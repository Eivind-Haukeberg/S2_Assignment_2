# Pharmacy Inventory Management System â€“ Assignment 2

This project is built as part of the **FFU1200 Frontend Development** course. It is a medicine inventory management system that allows users to add, edit, delete, and store medicine data using modern JavaScript (ES6 Classes), localStorage, and responsive design principles. The app was built with a clean, modular structure using Vite as the build tool. This README was drafted by ChatGPT and refined by the author.
